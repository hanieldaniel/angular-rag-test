# Troubleshooting "No Internet Connection"

If you're unable to connect to the internet, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Check Your Network Connection
Ensure that your Wi-Fi is enabled or your Ethernet cable is properly connected.

## Step 2: Restart Your Router
Unplug your router, wait 10 seconds, and plug it back in. Wait for all lights to stabilize before checking the connection again.

## Step 3: Restart Your Computer
Sometimes, simply restarting your computer can resolve network issues.

## Step 4: Run Network Troubleshooter (Windows)
1. Right-click the network icon in the system tray.
2. Select **Troubleshoot problems** and follow the on-screen instructions.

## Step 5: Reset Network Settings (Mac)
1. Go to **System Preferences** > **Network**.
2. Select **Wi-Fi**, click the minus button to remove it, then click the plus button to re-add it.

## Step 6: Contact Your ISP
If none of the above work, contact your Internet Service Provider for further assistance.
