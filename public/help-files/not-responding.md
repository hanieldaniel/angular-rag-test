# Troubleshooting "Program Not Responding"

If a program is not responding, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Wait a Few Moments
Sometimes a program may freeze temporarily due to heavy processing. Wait for a minute or two before trying anything else.

## Step 2: Force Quit the Program

**Windows:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` to open Task Manager.
2. Right-click the non-responding program and select **End Task**.

**Mac:**
1. Press `Cmd + Option + Esc`.
2. Select the non-responding program and click **Force Quit**.

## Step 3: Restart the Program
After closing the program, try reopening it to see if it works normally.

## Step 4: Check for Updates
Ensure the program is up to date by checking for any available updates or patches.

## Step 5: Reinstall the Program
Uninstall the program, restart your computer, and reinstall the program to ensure it's not corrupted.

## Step 6: Check System Resources
Open Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac) to check if your system is running out of memory or CPU resources. Close unnecessary applications and try again.
