# Troubleshooting Slow Computer

If your computer is running slow, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Restart Your Computer
Sometimes, a simple restart can clear temporary files and free up system resources.

## Step 2: Close Unnecessary Programs
Open **Task Manager** (Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` / Mac: `Cmd + Option + Esc`) and close programs you don't need.

## Step 3: Check for Malware
Run a virus scan using your antivirus software to rule out malware affecting performance.

## Step 4: Free Up Disk Space
- Delete old files and empty your Recycle Bin.
- Use **Disk Cleanup** (Windows) or **Optimize Storage** (Mac).

## Step 5: Disable Startup Programs
Windows:
1. Open **Task Manager** > **Startup** tab.
2. Disable unnecessary startup programs.

Mac:
1. Go to **System Preferences** > **Users & Groups** > **Login Items**.
2. Remove unnecessary items.

## Step 6: Upgrade RAM or Storage
If the problem persists, consider upgrading your computer's RAM or swapping to an SSD for faster performance.
