# Troubleshooting Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)

If you encounter a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) on Windows, try these steps:

## Step 1: Note the Error Code
Take note of the error code or stop code shown on the BSOD. This can provide clues about the problem.

## Step 2: Restart Your Computer
Restart your computer to see if the issue resolves itself.

## Step 3: Boot into Safe Mode
1. Restart your PC and press **F8** (or **Shift + F8**) during startup to access the boot options.
2. Select **Safe Mode** to troubleshoot without loading unnecessary drivers.

## Step 4: Update Drivers
Outdated or incompatible drivers can cause BSOD. Update all device drivers from **Device Manager**.

## Step 5: Run System File Checker (SFC)
1. Open **Command Prompt** as Administrator.
2. Type `sfc /scannow` and press Enter.
3. Let the scan complete and repair any corrupted files.

## Step 6: Uninstall Recent Updates or Software
If you started experiencing BSODs after installing updates or new software, try uninstalling them.

## Step 7: Check for Hardware Issues
Faulty RAM or hard drive could cause BSOD. Run memory diagnostic tests and check your hard drive for errors.
